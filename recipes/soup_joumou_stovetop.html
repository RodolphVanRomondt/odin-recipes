        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Juice from 2 lemons or limes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Garden sage fresh and chopped</li>
        <li>3 cups Shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Better than bouillon vegetable paste</li>

        <li>2 cups Vegetable broth</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium-size bowl, season the meat with salt and pepper,
             garlic, sage, 1 lemon or lime juice, and parsley.</li>
        <li>Marinate for 6-8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Transfer the meat with the marinating liquid to a 5-quart dutch
             oven, or deep pan. Add 8 cups of water, and cook on medium-high
              covering the pan halfway. Cook the meat for 2 hours. Be sure to
               check the water quantity so it does not dry. Add more water if
                needed as the meat cooks. In the end, you should have about 2
                 cups of water left with the meat. Reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li><p>Meanwhile, cook the squash until fork through (about 35 minutes). Remove
             the squash from the heat, cut in half, remove the seeds, and cut into
              small pieces. Feel free to leave the skin on.</p> 
            <p>Place the squash the blender, blend until liquify with cups of
                 vegetable broth and 2 cups of water.</p></li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the meat, stir. Add the bouillon paste and vegetables,
             cook for 10 minutes. Stir constantly.</li>
        <li>Add the juice from the other lemon or lime, then add the noodles. Cook for 10
             minutes. Stir. Serve warm with bread. Enjoy!</li>
